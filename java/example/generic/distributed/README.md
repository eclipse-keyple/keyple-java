Getting Started - Keyple Distributed Examples
---

Those projects demonstrate the multiple use cases covered by the **Keyple Distributed** solution. 

# Use Case #1 : Reader Server Side with Sync Network Protocol (Web Service) example
This project showcases the synchronous mode of the **Keyple Distributed** solution with a Web Service protocol.
This configuration allows a **server** application to control a smart card reader available on a **client** (e.g. PO reader).
See the [developer guide](https://keyple.org/docs/developer-guide/distributed-application/#reader-client-side).

# Use Case #1 : Reader Server Side with Async Network Protocol (Web Socket) example
This project showcases the implementation of the asynchronous mode of the **Keyple Distributed** solution with a Web Socket protocol.
This configuration allows a **server** application to control a smart card reader available on a **client** (e.g. PO reader).
See the [developer guide](https://keyple.org/docs/developer-guide/distributed-application/#reader-client-side).

# Use Case #7 : Pool Reader Server Side with Web Sync Network Protocol (Web Service) example
This project showcases the synchronous mode of the **Keyple Distributed** solution with a Web Service.
This configuration allows a **client** application to control a **pool** of smart cards readers available on a **server** (e.g. HSM readers).
See the [developer guide](https://keyple.org/docs/developer-guide/distributed-application/#pool-reader-server-side) for more details.
